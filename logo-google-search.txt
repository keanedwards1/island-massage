Optimize Your Website: Make sure your website is search engine optimized (SEO). 
This involves using proper HTML tags, meta descriptions, and alt text. For your logo, 
specifically, ensure the image file includes relevant keywords (e.g., your company name) 
in its file name and alt text.

Use Structured Data: Implement structured data on your website using schema.org markup. This helps Google understand the content on your site, including images. For logos, you can use the logo property within the Organization schema to directly tell Google which image is your logo.

Submit a Sitemap to Google: Include your logo image in an XML sitemap and submit it to Google via Google Search Console. This doesn't guarantee indexing but it does help Google discover and understand the content on your site.

Use High-Quality Images: Ensure your logo is of high quality, visually appealing, and looks good in different sizes. Google tends to rank high-quality images higher in its search results.

Embed Your Logo Throughout Your Website: Use your logo consistently across your website. The more it appears (in blog posts, headers, footers, etc.), the more likely it is to be indexed by Google.

Ensure Your Website is Mobile-Friendly: Google values mobile-friendliness as a ranking factor. Make sure your logo and site are optimized for mobile devices to improve your overall search visibility.

Social Media and External Websites: Use your logo on social media profiles and other external websites (like business directories). This increases your brand's visibility across the web, which can indirectly influence its visibility in search results.

Active Online Presence: Maintain an active online presence. Publish regular, quality content related to your brand and industry. Engage with your audience on social media, forums, and other platforms. An active presence can lead to more links and mentions, increasing your brand's visibility.

Link Building: Encourage reputable websites to link back to your site. Backlinks from authoritative sites can significantly boost your site's visibility in search results.

Monitor Your Performance: Use tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console to monitor your site's performance. These tools can provide insights into how your logo (and site) performs in search results and help identify areas for improvement.

By following these guidelines, you can increase the likelihood of your logo showing up in Google search results, enhancing your brand's visibility online.
